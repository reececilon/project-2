# Rock to Spock
Rock to Spock is an interesting take on the original rock, paper scizzors game. In this game there are two additional moves called *lizard* and *spock*. This adds a new dynamic to the game, allowing for new winning combinations in the game. The game is played against a computer which randomly selects moves from the available options. This allows the game to be completely random, making it difficult for the user to predict patterns.
