# Rock to Spock
Rock to Spock is an interesting take on the original rock, paper scizzors game. In this game there are two additional moves called *lizard* and *spock*. This adds a new dynamic to the game, allowing for new winning combinations in the game. The game is played against a computer which randomly selects moves from the available options. This allows the game to be completely random, making it difficult for the user to predict patterns.

- Game Controls
    - This includes six buttons to select the moves of: rock, paper, scizzors, lizard and spock.
    - The buttons have the same colour scheme as the header, with blue text against a black background encircled by a blue border.
    - The buttons also rotate when the user hovers over them to indicate that they are clickable.
    - When the buttons are clicked, the game initiates and the images for the player and computer change from the rule image to the corresponding slected move.

- Score Board
    - After the player and computer selects their moves, they are compared and then the score board keeps track of the wins of the player and computer.
    - Whilst the score is recorded, a popup is initiated to inform the user whether they *win, lose or draw* against the computer.

- Restart Button
    - The game also has a *Restart* button. The background turns blue and the colour of the text turns black when the user hovers over the button to indicate that it is different from the other buttons.
    - This button resets the game returning the player and the computer images to the starting image, showing the rules.
    - Also, resetting the score board back to zero for both the player and the computer.

## Future Feature to Implement

In the Future, I would like to make the move images for the player and computer to rotate before they change to the selected moves. This would represent how the original game is played, when the two players would say each move whilst bouncing their fists before deciding their move.
